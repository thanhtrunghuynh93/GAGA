The code repository for the fake news detection framework

The code is the combination of reproduced code from the two papers: 

GET: Evidence-aware Fake News Detection with Graph Neural Networks (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06885.pdf"> link </a>)
GAGA: Label Information Enhanced Fraud Detection against Low Homophily in Graphs (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10407.pdf"> link </a>)

Unzip the data and preprocessed data, the run file are in the folders
